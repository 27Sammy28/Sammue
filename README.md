In this projects, I conducted an analysis  on four prominent Machine Learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Extra Trees Classifier. 
Various metrics, such as Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy, and Overall Accuracy, were employed to compare the impact of using techniques like both with and without SMOTE and ADASYN on model performance, Hyperparameter Optimization.
When I Compared between Adaysn, Hyperparameter, Smote, and no smote,hyperparameter Optimization techniques performed better accuracy, precision, and OA. 
It is important to note that while the NO SMOTE approach appears to outperform ADASYN and SMOTE, a comprehensive investigation revealed that Hyperparameter Optimization using SVM yields the highest level of accuracy among these methods.
My findings indicate that the use of hyperparameter optimization is the most effective approach for improving the accuracy of my model. 
In addition to its superior performance, hyperparameter optimization offers greater flexibility and adaptability to various data sets, leading to more reliable and consistent results.
